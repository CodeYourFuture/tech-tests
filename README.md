# Tech Tests

This repository works a question bank that volunteers can use for conducting mock interviews.

## How to use it

1. Pick one of the top-level folders for the category that best describes your question type:
    - data-structures-and-algorithms - Usually language agnostic. Focus more on correct use of logic, algorithms and data structures
    - homework-assignment - An assignment to be given to the candidate to be completed offline
    - live-assignment - A task for the candidate to complete in a live coding session
2. Create a new folder for your question with a descriptive name inside the category folder
3. Inside your question folder, create a folder named `exercise`. A zip version of this folder will be given to the interviewee
4. Inside the `exercise` folder, add a `README.md` file. Ideally the file should contain:
    - The question and all relevant information
    - The evaluation criteria
5. Inside your question folder, create an `answer` folder with a sample answer so other interviewers can learn from it
