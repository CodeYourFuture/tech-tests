# Tech Tests

This repository works as a question bank that volunteers can use for conducting mock interviews.

## How do the Tests Comprise a Mock Interview?

For mock interviews to be effective, you have to expose the candidates to as many potential assessment methods as possible, so that they are well prepared for the real thing.

Part of this will involve a well-conducted technical challenge in order to assess the following characteristics:

* A candidate's approach to finding a solution to the problem
* A candidate's ability to design a solution to the problem and describe the design
* A candidate's approach to test-driven design and development
* The quality of the implemented solution itself

A mistake often made is just focussing on the last point, but employers of good software engineers will look at all of the above.

Whan assessing a candidate's attempt at one of these tests, be sure to assess and give feedback on all of the above.  There will be other questions and exercises beyond these tech tests too.  **The aim of this is to ensure all technical tests are conducted consistently during mock interviews.**


## How to use these Tests

1. Pick one of the top-level folders for the category that best describes your question type:
    - data-structures-and-algorithms - Usually language agnostic. Focus more on correct use of logic, algorithms and data structures
    - homework-assignment - An assignment to be given to the candidate to be completed offline
    - live-assignment - A task for the candidate to complete in a live coding session or mock interview
1. Within the folder chosen in 1. there will be some question folders, each of which contains a different technical test.
1. Inside the question folder, there is a folder called `exercise`. A zip version of this folder will be given to the interviewee.
1. Inside the `exercise` folder, there is a `README.md` file containing the following:
    - The question and all relevant information
    - The evaluation criteria
1. Also inside your question folder, alongside the `exercise` folder, there is an `answer` folder containing a model answer for reference.  This is unlikely to be the only correct or valid implementation, but it should give a good idea to the interviewer of what to look for in a good solution.


## Can't Candidates Cheat if there are Model Answers?

It's a fair question.  This is a public repository and in theory candidates could view all the model answers to all the questions and learn them in advance of the interview.

However, by learning all the answers to all the questions, candidates actually learn a lot about how to engineer software, so by "cheating" they become better developers.  As such, a better performance in the interview relative to someone who hasn't done all the practice questions is justified.  It's also true that, since we're not just looking at the implemented solution, the candidates will still need to explain how and why they've arrived at the particular solution, so would quickly get found out if they've just learned the answer by heart and didn't understand what they're typing.

The CYF tech leadership have therefore decided that being open about the questions and answers is a good thing and will lead to candidates being better prepared for real interviews.
